Ideas for future improvements:

* Allow excluding sets (or changing weights) from the command line

* Extend documentation

* New effect: transport (horizontal (trains, cars), vertical (rockets!))

* Allow changing the escape clause

* Allow importdirs without config.xml (just assigning rotate and flip effects to the available images (+sounds?)

* Test multi-image animation
