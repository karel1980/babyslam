Ideas for future improvements:

Documentation:
  make it more appealing to non-technical users.
  provide UI for adding sets? (basic 'sets' don't need config.xml. just enable rotate and flip effects by default, ui for configuring other effects)

Uncategorized:

* Allow excluding sets (or changing weights) from the command line

* New effect: transport (horizontal (trains, cars), vertical (rockets!))

* Allow changing the escape clause

* Allow importdirs without config.xml (just assigning rotate and flip effects to the available images (+sounds?)

* Test multi-image animation
