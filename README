== INTRODUCTION

This program is intended to let baby's slam away on the computer's keyboard
without being able to break stuff.

Laptop owners beware: Slamming the laptop keyboard kills hard drives.  Buy a cheap keyboard and give that to the baby.
Make sure the keyboard is not on the same surface (vibrations still get to the laptop's hard drive if it's on the same surface).

I am not responsible for any damage this program or your baby delivers to your computer.

== INSTALLATION

git clone git://github.com/karel1980/babyslam.git
cd babyslam

== USAGE
To the program, execute './babyslam.py'

To quit, type 'babydodo' (the so called 'escape clause' is always noted in the top-left corner)

== CUSTOMIZING
 - You can change the escape clause by editing babyslam.py (todo:
 - You can add images / sounds by dumping png and wav/ogg files in media/.  A nice example
   is to add a picture of mom and dad (mom.png, dad.png & matching audio file (mom.wav, dad.wav))

== COST
 - This program is free as in love in the sixties.  However, if you (and your baby) really enjoy the program send a postcard to:
     Outerthought - Karel Vervaeke
     Technologiepark 3
     9052 Zwijnaarde
     Belgium

== TODO
 - set up a proper site & documentation
 - work with 'sets' of images - e.g. 'shapes', 'family', 'animals', 'colors', ...
 - separate program for making configuration changes (escape clause, configuring which sets to use, ...)
 - ogg support is untested, but should work.
 - (low priority) other media types (jpeg, gif, mp3, ...)?
 - support windows & mac
 - package (deb and rpm for linux, zip/exe for windows, pkg (or whatever is the preferred mac packaging mechanism nowadays))

== BUGS
 - none (just kidding, report them to karel.vervaeke(AT)telenet.be).
 - patches to the same address (or fork and send pull requests).

== WANTED
 - Someone with experience with packaging pygame games (deb,rpm,exe,... - dependencies: python-pygame, (future) python-gconf2 // what about windows variant?)
 - Send all your patches/question/feedback to karel.vervaeke(AT)telenet.be

== NOTES
Please ignore this.  They are just random scribbles
 - pygame2exe!
 - conf module
     linux -> import gconf
     windows (python<3.0) -> import _winreg
     windows (python>=3.0) -> import winreg
     mac -> ??
 - icon for packaged installer / add to start menu for different platforms
