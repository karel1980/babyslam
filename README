== INTRODUCTION

This program is intended to let baby's slam away on the computer's keyboard
without being able to break stuff.

Laptop owners beware: Slamming the laptop keyboard kills hard drives.  Buy a cheap keyboard and give that to the baby.
Make sure the keyboard is not on the same surface (vibrations still get to the laptop's hard drive if it's on the same surface).

I am not responsible for any damage this program or your baby delivers to your computer.

== INSTALLATION

git clone git://github.com/karel1980/babyslam.git
cd babyslam
sudo python setup.py install

== RUNNING
To the program, execute 'babyslam' (installed in /usr/local/bin with the above commands

Running from source (./src/script/babyslam) is not possible at the moment.

== USAGE
To quit, type 'babydodo' (this so called 'escape clause' is always noted in the top-left corner, later you will be able to set your own escape clause).

== CUSTOMIZING
 - Adding your own images / sounds is very easy.  To get started, unzip 'sample_animals.zip' in ~/.babyslam/sets (you should now have a config.xml file at ~/.babyslam/sets/sample_animals/config.xml).  Kids generally respond very well to 'mommy' and 'daddy' (with matching sound files saying 'mommy' and 'daddy' in an enthusiastic voice)

== COST
 - This program is free as in love in the sixties.  However, if you (and your baby) really enjoy the program, spread the word.

== TODO
 - set up a proper site & improve documentation
 - separate program for making configuration changes (escape clause, enabling/disabling sets, ...)
 - test other image and sound formats (although everything supported by pygame should work)
 - support windows & mac
 - package (deb and rpm for linux, zip/exe for windows, pkg (or whatever is the preferred mac packaging mechanism nowadays))

== BUGS
 - none (just kidding, report them to karel.vervaeke(AT)telenet.be).
 - patches to the same address (or fork and send pull requests via github).

== WANTED
 - Someone with experience with packaging pygame games (deb,rpm,exe,... - dependencies: python-pygame, (future) python-gconf2 // what about windows variant?)
 - Send all your patches/question/feedback to karel.vervaeke(AT)telenet.be

== NOTES
Please ignore this.  They are just random scribbles
 - pygame2exe!
 - conf module
     linux -> import gconf
     windows (python<3.0) -> import _winreg
     windows (python>=3.0) -> import winreg
     mac -> ??
 - icon for packaged installer / add to start menu for different platforms
